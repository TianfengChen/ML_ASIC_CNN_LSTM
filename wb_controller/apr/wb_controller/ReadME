ECO REQUIRED:
1. Copy *.syn.v and *.sdc from ../syn/data/ into ./synth_res
2. Check/Modify *.sdc:
	- Make sure special constraints like set_dont_touch, set_false_path and set_disable_timing are inherited properly. Fix them if not.
	- Remove any set_ideal_network constraints on the clocks, or CTS will not take effect.
