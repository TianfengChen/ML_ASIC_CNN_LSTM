Streaming-in GDS
- Use Template:
	./strmIn.template

- Reference Libraries:
	./mult_chip.reflib

DRC Signing-off
- DRC Runset:
	./Calibre/DRC/drc.runset

- Include "EXCLUDE CELL" in DRC
	IBM130 PADs and compiler SRAMs have internal DRC violations (mostly intentional for denser layout) 
	that we cannot fix or will be waived in a real tapeout, so we want to exclude them from DRC.
	To do that, refer to ./Calibre/DRC/drc.exclude and "DRC Options" -> "Include" in the Calibre DRC 
	GUI after loading the runset. Specifically in this design, I am excluding all the PADs and SIGN_MEM.

- Violations in this design
	- GR612c_V3/GR612b_V3:
		-	After APR, this design ends up having two DRC violations for each of the above rules,
		which complains too few V3 contacts for two tie-high/tie-low nets, where thin M3 wires tries to 
		via M4 power stripes (very wide). 
	  		In your final DRC there might be some DRCs similar to those ones that are caused by either 
		poorly-designed technology LEF file or poor P&R CAD SW. It is very hard to go back and resort to 
		APR/innovus for resolving them. But typically, there won't be many and most of them are easy to 
		understand and fix by hand.
	  		For signing-off DRC of this template design, a simple fix of adding two more V3 shapes to 
		each of those connections resolves those DRC violations.

LVS Signing-off
- LVS Runset:
	./Calibre/LVS/lvs.runset

- Adding top-level I/O labels
	Most labels are automatically placed (on M6 of PADs) by APR to the GDS output. But somehow the PAD APR database in this
	technology does not support DVDD/DVSS as PG pins and their logical connections cannot be made in APR. Thus their labels
	are the only ones not placed in layout. After streaming-in, you want to place DVDD/DVSS labels on the wire-bonding contact
	of DVDD/DVSS PADs, which is layer 'TD', a 'hidden' topmost metal layer even above M8. The shapes should become obvious once
	you turn-on all the layout details and set 'TD' to be the only visible layer.

- Black Boxing in LVS
	IBM130 PADs and compiler SRAMs have internal LVS violations that we cannot fix or will be waived in a real tapeout, 
	so we do not want to check their internal LVS. To do that, refer to ./Calibre/LVS/lvs.box and "LVS Options" -> "Include" 
	in the Calibre LVS GUI after loading the runset. Specifically in this design, I am black boxing all the PADs and SIGN_MEM.

Final Design Libraries:
	- mult_chip: streamed-in from post-APR GDS file. Not changed and preserves the DRC violations.
	- mult_chip_tapeout: DRC-and-LVS signed-off design with DRC in mult_chip fixed, DVDD/DVSS labels placed and ready for taping-out.
