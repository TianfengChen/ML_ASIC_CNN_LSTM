ECO REQUIRED:
1. Copy *.apr.physical.v here, add power supplys to the top-level I/Os definition and modify them to be inout ports instead of wires.
   Also, for a design with PAD ring, you need to connect all PADs to their designated VDD/VSS and DVDD/DVSS. That is because VDD/VSS and DVDD/DVSS
   pins of some PAD cells are not present as PG pins in the provided technology files and are thus not recognizable for APR. Then logical connections
   of those pins are not properly made. Specifically in this design, I will copy the PAD ring in mult_chip_padring.v (make one and re-use) over to 
   replace the one in mult_chip.apr.physical.v whenever a new APR database has been generated.

2. Make sure the netlists (cdl/spice) of lower-level blocks all use triangle brackets (<>) for bus I/Os instead of square ones ([]).
   E.g., SRAM compiler gives you netlists of '[]' bus I/Os and you want to make copies and modify them to use '<>'.
   Then use the copies for v2lvs. Specifically in design, I am using SIGN_MEM_tri.cdl (modified) instead of SIGN_MEM.cdl (from compiler).

Running v2lvs:
	$ ./v2lvs.sh mult_chip
